# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The bug is caused by an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an index beyond the bounds of the array, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The `Bug.java` file contains the buggy code, and the `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected version.
